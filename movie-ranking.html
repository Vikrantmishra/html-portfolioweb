<h1>Vikrant's Favourite Movies Collection</h1>
<h2>My top three favourite movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3> Mission Impossible serious </h3>
<p> Since my childhood i have always been the die heart fan of tom cruise and the way he had acted in his mission impossible serious is phenomenon. </p>
<h3>John Wick serious</h3>
<p> It is quite difficult for me to peak a single movie from the John Wick serious because they all are awesome and that why favourite as well.</p>
<h3>3 Idiot</h3>
<P>This movie i would recommend to watch every one no matter what age group you belong to as this movie talk about the mental health of students
and the pressure they face from society.It also give a strong message to the parent of the society to let your children do in which they are
interested rather than forcing them to do whatyou want them to do.
